    <h1>Code Log 3: CSS Media Queries</h1>

    <h3>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h3>
    <p> A CSS media query checks the characteristics of a device, such as screen size or resolution,
        and applies certain styles only when specific conditions are met. It is useful because it
        allows websites to adjust their layout and design for different devices, keeping them
        responsive and user friendly across all screens.</p>

    <h3>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what do they
        do? Pick any 4 to explain.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>max-width:</strong> Targets devices with a screen width up to a specific value.
            Commonly used for responsive layouts that adjust for smaller screens like phones or tablets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>min-width:</strong> Targets devices with a screen width greater than or equal to a
            specific value. It helps apply styles for larger screens such as laptops or desktops.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>orientation:</strong> Detects whether a device is in portrait or landscape mode.
            Useful for adjusting layouts on mobile or tablet devices depending on how they are held.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>prefers-color-scheme:</strong> Checks whether the user has set their system to light
            mode or dark mode. This lets websites automatically match the user’s color preference.
        </li>
    </ol>


    <style>
        ol li::marker {
            font-weight: bold;
            /* makes the numbers bold */
        }

        li {
            margin-bottom: 10px;
            /* adds 10px of space below each item */
        }
    </style>
