        <h2>The Angel Motif</h2>
        <p>
            Though no living angel appears in <em>Angel's Egg</em>, the film is shaped by the haunting presence of the 
            fossilized angel beneath the cathedral—one of its most iconic images. This immense skeletal figure suggests 
            a divine being long dead, preserved only as a monument to forgotten belief. Its wings, ribs, and posture evoke 
            both beauty and ruin, setting the spiritual tone of the film.
        </p>
        <p>
            The angel's absence—paired with its overwhelming physical imprint—creates a sense of spiritual loss. 
            It stands as a reminder of a time when faith may have been alive and embodied, now reduced to silence and stone.
        </p>

        <h2>Symbolic Interpretations</h2>
        <p>
            Many viewers read the angel as a metaphor for the death of certainty or organized belief. It represents a 
            vanished divine order, leaving behind only myths, rituals, and stories that no longer provide answers. 
            Its fossilization implies distance: a divine presence that has receded beyond reach, leaving humans with only 
            the traces and shapes of the sacred.
        </p>
        <p>
            Others interpret it as the embodiment of a promise that was never fulfilled, or a once-living ideal now 
            preserved only through the Girl’s fragile devotion.
        </p>

        <h2>Connection to the Characters</h2>
        <p>
            For the Girl, the angel is a source of hope and a symbol of purity—something she strives to protect through 
            the egg. For the Boy, the angel is part of a story he no longer believes in, a legend whose meaning has eroded. 
            Their contrasting perspectives reflect the film’s deeper struggle between belief and doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
            The angel motif anchors the emotional and thematic core of the film: the longing for transcendence in a world 
            that may no longer hold the divine.
