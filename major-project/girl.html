        <h2>Character Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Girl is the emotional and symbolic center of <em>Angel’s Egg</em>. She wanders through the desolate world
            with a quiet devotion to the egg she protects. Her belief in its importance shapes every part of her life,
            even though the nature of what lies inside is never revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her silence, uncertainty, and vulnerability give the film its emotional weight. She moves with ritualistic
            purpose, collecting water, tending to the egg, and avoiding the strange forces of the world around her.
        </p>

        <h2>Symbolic Meaning</h2>
        <p>
            Many interpretations view the Girl as a representation of unquestioning faith — a commitment to hope or belief
            even when there is no proof. Others see her as a symbol of innocence, childhood, or the sacred fragility of
            holding onto meaning in a world that offers none.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her devotion to the egg reflects both trust and longing. Whatever she expects to hatch from it, the film frames
            her belief as something beautiful yet deeply vulnerable.
        </p>

        <h2>Role in the Story</h2>
        <p>
            Through her interactions with the Boy, the film explores faith, doubt, and the longing for understanding. Their
            brief connection forms the emotional core of the narrative. Her loss becomes one of the most haunting moments
            in the film, echoing its themes of abandonment and broken belief.
