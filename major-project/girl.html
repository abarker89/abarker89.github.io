            <h2>The Girl</h2>
            <p>Innocence, belief, and the fragile mystery of the egg she protects.</p>

        <h2>Character Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Girl is the emotional and symbolic center of <em>Angel’s Egg</em>. She moves through the silent,
            desolate world with an almost ritualistic devotion to the egg she carries. Her behavior suggests she
            believes the egg contains something sacred—something she must protect at all costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much of her character is expressed through gesture and atmosphere rather than dialogue. Her loneliness,
            her childlike trust, and her quiet desperation shape the tone of the film.
        </p>

        <h2>Symbolic Readings</h2>
        <p>
            The Girl is often interpreted as a representation of faith—pure, unwavering, and vulnerable.
            Her attachment to the egg reflects the human tendency to invest belief in unseen or unknowable things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some viewers interpret her as a stand-in for abandoned faith, childhood innocence, or the remnants
            of spiritual hope in a ruined world. Others see her as a tragic figure trapped in a cycle of
            longing and disappointment.
        </p>

        <h2>Role in the Narrative</h2>
        <p>
            Her interactions with the Boy serve as the emotional core of the story. Through their brief, quiet
            exchanges,
            the film explores themes of trust, doubt, and the fragility of belief. Her reaction to the loss of the egg
            becomes one of the most haunting moments in the entire film.
