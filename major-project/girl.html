        <h2>Her Symbolism</h2>

        <p>
            The girl is the emotional and symbolic core of <em>Angel’s Egg</em>. She wanders through a desolate,
            drowned city while clutching a mysterious egg — caring for it with a devotion that feels spiritual,
            instinctive, and childlike. Her silence, her delicate movements, and her haunted expressions suggest 
            a being caught between innocence and knowledge, faith and fear.
        </p>

        <h2>The Egg as Identity</h2>

        <p>
            For many viewers, the egg becomes a metaphor for belief, memory, or selfhood — something fragile she is
            desperately trying to protect in a world that offers no reassurance. Her connection to it is never explained,
            which reinforces the dreamlike ambiguity of the film.
        </p>

        <h2>Her Relationship with the Soldier</h2>

        <p>
            When the soldier appears, the film shifts into a quiet psychological tension. Their interactions are gentle
            yet unsettling, as if the presence of another person threatens the fragile interior world she has built.
            Through their conversations — or her silence — themes of trust, betrayal, and doubt rise to the surface.
        </p>

        <p>
            Her character ultimately invites interpretation rather than answers, reflecting the film’s broader
            exploration of myth, faith, and the human desire to hold onto meaning.
