            <h2>Mamoru Oshii</h2>

    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->

        <h2>The Director's Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Mamoru Oshii approached <em>Angel’s Egg</em> during a transitional point in his life, both artistically and 
            spiritually. Rather than telling a traditional story, he created a meditative film that explores belief, loss, 
            and the quiet spaces between thoughts.
        </p>

        <h2>A Story Told Through Silence</h2>
        <p>
            Oshii is known for deliberate pacing and introspective storytelling, and this film is his most extreme example. 
            Dialogue is sparse and the atmosphere carries the emotional weight. Quiet moments become symbolic gestures, 
            allowing viewers to project their own interpretations onto the film.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Symbolism</h2>
        <p>
            Oshii’s shifting relationship with religion is reflected throughout the film. The imagery of water, rebirth, 
            unreachable faith, and fragile hope mirrors his internal struggle. The girl and the boy can be seen as opposing 
            states of belief and doubt.
        </p>

        <h2>Working with Yoshitaka Amano</h2>
        <p>
            While Amano shaped the visual language of the world, Oshii set its emotional rhythm. Their collaboration created 
            a film where every frame feels painterly and loaded with meaning. The stylized characters move through Oshii’s 
            slow, dreamlike spaces in a way that feels almost ritualistic.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Though not a commercial success, <em>Angel’s Egg</em> became a cult classic and influenced later works like 
            <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>. Its themes of identity, memory, and spiritual ambiguity echo throughout Oshii’s 
            filmography. This remains his most personal and uncompromising film.
