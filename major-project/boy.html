    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
    <main>
        <h2>Character Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Boy enters <em>Angel’s Egg</em> as a quiet, unsettling presence — a figure who seems to know more about
            the world than the Girl does, yet holds no certainty of his own. With his engraved cross-shaped weapon and
            emotionless gaze, he embodies both companionship and threat. His calm questioning contrasts sharply with the
            Girl’s unwavering devotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the Girl moves with instinctive faith, the Boy approaches everything with doubt and detachment. His
            cryptic story of the bird that once flew away mirrors the film’s central emotional conflict: belief confronted
            by disillusionment.
        </p>

        <h2>Symbolic Interpretations</h2>
        <p>
            Viewers often interpret the Boy as a manifestation of skepticism — a force that challenges fragile belief.
            Others see him as a messenger or “angelic” figure himself, sent to test the Girl’s devotion. His ambiguity is
            intentional: Oshii designed him as a counterpart to the Girl's innocence, representing the painful transition
            from faith into questioning.
        </p>
        <p>
            His cross-like weapon emphasizes themes of religion, burden, and judgment. He carries it not as a tool, but as
            an emblem of a forgotten—or rejected—system of belief.
        </p>

        <h2>Role in the Narrative</h2>
        <p>
            The Boy’s presence accelerates the Girl’s tragedy. His gentle yet probing questions introduce doubt, and his
            final actions shatter the world she has constructed around the egg. Whether he acts out of cruelty, duty, or
            his own longing for truth remains deliberately unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, the Boy and Girl form the emotional axis of the film: faith and doubt intertwined, shaping and
            undoing one another in a world where meaning is uncertain.
